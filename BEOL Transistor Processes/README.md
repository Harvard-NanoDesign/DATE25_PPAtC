BEOL Transistor Processes

This sheet outlines the process steps used to model the fabrication process for the BEOL IGZO and CNT transistors. Each step is provided, along with the tool, material, and deposition thickness (as appropriate) used in the source referenced for the step. This is then matched to a process step (dry etch, EUV lithography, wet etch, or deposition), along with the corresponding step energy. This is summed to obtain total fabrication energy for a transistor layer.
