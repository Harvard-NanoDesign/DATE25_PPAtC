This folder contains log files from the IC design simulations we performed. We performed logic synthesis & place-and-route (Cadence Genus & Cadence Innovus) over a range of
design parameters to generate multiple options for fCLK and energy consumption of our system and sweep VT of the FETs over all options offered
in the ASAP7 standard cell library. We perform RTL simulations to obtain cycle-accurate digital waveforms for each net in our computing system.
