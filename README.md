# PPAtC

Power, performance, area and total carbon footprint of integrated circuits including:
- BEOL transistor process modeling
- Embodied carbon estimation
- Process energy estimation
- Process and fabrication energy estimates
- Total carbon delay product analysis
- Carbon analysis case study notebook

In the figure below, the colormap in (a) indicates the relative tCDP of the M3D design vs.
the all-Si design. The dashed black line is the tCDP isoline; and (b) shows variation in the
tCDP isoline due to: 6 month increase/decrease in system lifetime (red dashed
lines), 3Ã— increase/decrease in CIuse of the U.S. grid (green dashed lines), and
10%/90% M3D yield (purple dashed lines).
