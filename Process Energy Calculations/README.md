Process Energy Calculations

This sheet calculates the energy/step values (in kWh/step/wafer) used to approximate the energy of a single dry etch, EUV lithography exposure, metallization, wet etch, or deposition step. [6] reports the process complexity of 9 BEOL metal line fabrication/patterning processes by lithographic method used (Figure 3), reporting the number of dry etch, lithography, metallization, metrology, wet etch, and deposition steps needed. [6] also reports the electrical energy per wafer for the same 9 metal line fabrication/patterning processes, broken down by amount of energy from each process (Figure 8). Dividing the total energy used by a process step by the number of times that process step is used obtains energy/step in kWh/step/wafer.

Because the IGZO and CNT transistors in the M3D design in our paper are modeled at a 7nm node, with our overall design following the specifications of the ASAP7 PDK, we base our analysis around the process energies reported to fabricate a metal line with single-patterning EUV (“Metal line LE (EUV)” in Figures 3 and 8). [8] Because there is no data on deposition for this process, we use the EUV LE2 data (“Metal SA-LE2 grating (EUVL)”) process energies for energy/step of deposition.
